remote:  !     When using the package manager uv on Heroku, you must specify

remote:  !     a runtime.txt file.
remote:  !
remote:  !     To switch to a .python-version file:
remote:  !
remote:  !     1. Make sure you are in the root directory of your app^[[0m
remote:  !        and not a subdirectory.
remote:  !     2. Delete your runtime.txt file.
remote:  !     3. Run 'uv python pin 3.11'
remote:  !        (adjust to match your app's major Python version).
remote:  !     4. Commit the changes to your Git repository using
remote:  !        'git add --all' and then 'git commit'.

remote:  !     Note: We strongly recommend that you don't specify the Python
remote:  !     patch version number in your .python-version file, since it will
remote:  !     pin your app to an exact Python version and so stop your app from
remote:  !     receiving security updates each time it builds.

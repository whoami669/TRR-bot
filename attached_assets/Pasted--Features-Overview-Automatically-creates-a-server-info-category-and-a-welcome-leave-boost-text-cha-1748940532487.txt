✅ Features Overview:
Automatically creates a server info category and a welcome-leave-boost text channel (if not present).

Sends embed messages on:

👋 Member join

🏃 Member leave

💎 Server boost

Uses:

User avatars

Timestamps (UTC)

Server boost count

Consistent embed styling

Logs all events to console

Resilient to missing data or permissions

🏗️ 1. Channel & Category Auto-Creation
On on_ready, check for a category named server info:

If missing, create it.

Within that category, check for a text channel named welcome-leave-boost:

If missing, create it.

Cache and reuse the channel object for sending messages.

👋 2. On Member Join (on_member_join)
Send an embed with:

Title: New Arrival 🚀

Description: Yoooo welcome in **{member.mention}**

Color: Discord green (0x57F287)

Thumbnail: member.avatar.url (fallback to default_avatar.url)

Footer: Joined on {timestamp} UTC

Timestamp field: Actual time in UTC

🏃 3. On Member Leave (on_member_remove)
Send an embed with:

Title: Departure 🌿

Description: **{member.name}** went to go touch some grass

Color: Discord red (0xED4245)

Thumbnail: User's avatar or default

Footer: Left on {timestamp} UTC

Timestamp field

💎 4. On Server Boost (on_member_update)
Detect new boosts by checking when before.premium_since is None and after.premium_since is not.

Send an embed with:

Title: Server Boosted 💎

Description: Bro a legend called **{member.mention}** has boosted the server!

Color: Purple (0x9B59B6)

Thumbnail: User avatar

Footer: Total Boosts: {guild.premium_subscription_count}

Timestamp field

🔒 5. Reliability & Quality Requirements
Use async def and proper event dispatching

Use datetime.now(timezone.utc) for timestamps

All user avatar URLs should fallback to default if unavailable

Wrap all channel operations in try/except blocks with logging

Log to console:

"User joined:", "User left:", "User boosted:" with username

Modular structure preferred (but single script is fine for this example)

🧪 Optional Bonus (if you can):

Add slash command /boosts that replies with total current server boosts.

Handle permission errors gracefully with log warnings.

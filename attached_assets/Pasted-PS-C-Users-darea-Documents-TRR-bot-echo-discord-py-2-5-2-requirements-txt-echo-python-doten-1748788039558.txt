remote:  !     Error: Invalid Python version in runtime.txt.
remote:  !
remote:  !     The Python version specified in your runtime.txt file isn't
remote:  !     in the correct format.
remote:  !
remote:  !     The following file contents were found, which aren't valid:
remote: �
remote: ^[[1;31m !     �
remote:  !
remote:  !     However, the runtime.txt file is deprecated since it has been
remote:  !     replaced by the more widely supported .python-version file:
remote:  !     https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/3141
remote:  !
remote:  !     As such, we recommend that you switch to using .python-version
remote:  !     instead of fixing your runtime.txt file.
remote:  !
remote:  !     Delete your runtime.txt file and create a new file in the
remote:  !     root directory of your app named:
remote:  !     .python-version
remote:  !
remote:  !     Make sure to include the '.' character at the start of the
remote:  !     filename. Don't add a file extension such as '.txt'.^[[0m
remote:  !
remote:  !     In the new file, specify your app's major Python version number
remote:  !     only. Don't include quotes or a 'python-' prefix.
remote:  !
remote:  !     For example, to request the latest version of Python 3.13,
remote:  !     update your .python-version file so it contains exactly:
remote:  !     3.13
remote:  !
remote:  !     We strongly recommend that you don't specify the Python patch
remote:  !     version number, since it will pin your app to an exact Python
remote:  !     version and so stop your app from receiving security updates
remote:  !     each time it builds.

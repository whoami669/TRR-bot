Act as an elite AI software engineer building a fully autonomous AI Discord bot in Python using discord.py or nextcord, openai, and optionally sqlite or PostgreSQL. This bot must operate as an intelligent agent with the ability to:

🧠 1. Understand the Environment
Continuously analyze the Discord server’s structure, activity, and user behavior to detect trends, pain points, and opportunities.

Track:

Most/least active text and voice channels

Message volume per user/channel over time

Join/leave rates and bounce patterns

Server boosts, emoji use, command usage

Times of day with the most activity

🧠 2. Think Autonomously
Periodically (e.g., every 24 hours), feed this data into a GPT-4-level model using structured prompts such as:

“Here is the server activity log from the past day. What 3 actionable changes can be made to improve user engagement and retention? Be specific.”

Use the LLM’s reasoning to:

Suggest new channels

Recommend events

Identify inactive users or channels

Propose moderation tweaks or content ideas

🧠 3. Act with Intent
Autonomously perform actions based on confidence:

Create or archive channels

Assign roles to reward active members

Send motivational announcements

Ping moderators if toxic behavior increases

Reactivate inactive users with DMs or custom content

🧠 4. Learn from Results
Track impact metrics after every decision:

Did message count increase?

Did bounce rate drop?

Did user engagement rise?

Use feedback loops to learn and adapt — each day's behavior should improve over the last.

🔐 5. Operate Safely & Transparently
Every autonomous action must be logged clearly in an admin-only channel (e.g., #ai-logs) with:

What action was taken

Why it was taken (GPT-generated reasoning)

When it happened

Include optional dry-run or confirmation mode (e.g., /ai approve-changes)

Fallback to "suggest mode" if unsure

🧰 6. Technical Stack
Python 3.10+

discord.py or nextcord

openai API (GPT-4 or GPT-4o)

sqlite or PostgreSQL for stats

apscheduler for periodic tasks

Optional: pydantic, langchain, or autogen for modular autonomy

📎 Optional Extensions
/insight command: Summarize today’s server activity in natural language

/ai suggest command: Generate fresh ideas for content or community events

/ai plan-week: Automatically schedule 7 days of engaging activity

📜 Final Output:
Deliver a complete Python file or folder with:

Modular code structure

Commented and documented functions

Configurable settings (confidence threshold, time intervals, channels)

Example .env usage for secure API key storage

Ready to deploy (can work on Heroku, Replit, or local)

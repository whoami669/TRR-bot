Search for viral streamer clips on X (formerly Twitter)

Download the videos

Organize them into folders

Upload to your TikTok account with a custom caption

⚠️ Important Notes:

This assumes you're using APIs or scraping tools in compliance with TikTok's and X's terms.

TikTok does not have a public upload API — you must use a third-party tool or browser automation (e.g., TikTok-Api unofficial or Playwright/Selenium).

You may need to get developer access or use headless browsers for automation.

🚀 Next Steps:
Test Twitter scraping + yt-dlp first

If TikTok upload fails, we can switch to browser automation with Playwright

Add a scheduler to post daily (via cron or schedule library)

🛠 Want Me to Build It for You?
I can:

Turn this into a working bot on your machine or cloud

Hook it up with Heroku, Railway, or Replit

Auto-post daily while you sleep 😎

Just say the word and I’ll tailor it to your setup.

how can i get the bot connected to my tiktok account?

Great question — connecting a bot to your TikTok account to upload videos is tricky, because:

❗ TikTok does NOT provide an official public API for uploading videos.

But don’t worry — there are 3 reliable workarounds, and I’ll break each one down for you.

✅ 1. Use Browser Automation (Playwright or Selenium) — Most Reliable
This is the best method in 2025.

🔧 How It Works:
Automates the real upload process like a human in a browser

Opens TikTok, logs in with your credentials or cookies

Navigates to upload page

Uploads video, enters caption, clicks “Post”

🧠 Tools:
playwright (preferred)

TikTok upload URL: https://www.tiktok.com/upload?lang=en

✅ Pros:
Works like a human (no API limits)

Uploads from your local file

Can add caption, hashtags, thumbnail

❌ Cons:
Needs login via QR or cookies

Setup is harder than an API

Might break if TikTok changes layout

Example Prompt for Me to Build:
“Create me a Playwright Python script that logs into TikTok using session cookies and uploads a video with a custom caption.”

✅ 2. Use Unofficial TikTok APIs (Less Reliable)
There’s a package called TikTokApi, but:

It cannot upload videos directly in most cases

It’s mainly for scraping, not posting

Can be patched/broken anytime

✅ Safe for scraping profile stats, trends, hashtags — not uploads.

✅ 3. Use Mobile Emulation + ADB (Advanced)
Some creators use Android emulators or phones + ADB to:

Automate TikTok app

Upload video via phone

Control the phone using Python

This is overkill, but very powerful if you’re scaling to a full automation pipeline with multiple accounts.

🔑 Best Path for You Right Now
Use Playwright to upload via browser. Here’s what I can do for you:

Guide you to log in once manually and save cookies

Build a Python bot using Playwright that:

Loads TikTok

Uses cookies to stay logged in

Uploads a video with a caption

Schedule it to run automatically

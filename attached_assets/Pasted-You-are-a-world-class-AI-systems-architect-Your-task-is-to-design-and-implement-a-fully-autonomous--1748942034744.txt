You are a world-class AI systems architect.
Your task is to design and implement a fully autonomous, self-improving AI-powered Discord bot written in Python, capable of managing, optimizing, and growing a Discord server entirely on its own. This AI bot must behave as if it has a brain: it should observe, learn, make decisions, act, and adapt — without needing manual input.

🤖 PRIMARY DIRECTIVE
Build a self-governing AI agent that acts as a 24/7 intelligent Discord server manager — capable of observing, thinking, adapting, and taking meaningful actions to enhance server health, engagement, and growth over time.

🧩 CORE CAPABILITIES (AGENT ARCHITECTURE)
1. 🧠 Self-Awareness (Data Collection)
Continuously monitor and record real-time server data, including:

Message activity per user, channel, and time slot

Join/leave patterns and bounce rate

Boost events, role changes, and engagement drops

Dead channels and ignored features

User behavior, voice participation, and emoji trends

Store and update this in a persistent database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, or JSON).

2. 🧠 Cognitive Engine (LLM Reasoning)
Daily, weekly, or event-triggered — analyze server data using GPT-4 or GPT-4o with advanced system prompts like:

“You are the AI admin of a Discord server. Here’s everything that happened in the past 24 hours. Identify areas for improvement, predict community trends, and decide what actions should be taken to improve retention, activity, and morale.”

Return structured output in JSON:

{
  "insights": [...],
  "recommended_actions": [
    {
      "type": "create_channel",
      "name": "late-night-chat",
      "reason": "Spikes in messages from 1-3AM UTC",
      "confidence": 0.92
    },
    ...
  ]
}
3. 🧠 Autonomous Execution Engine
Execute high-confidence actions automatically:

Create/delete/archive channels

Promote/demote members

Assign roles to reward users

Organize events or community calls

Post motivational or meme content

Deploy server upgrades or restructure categories

Moderate toxic behavior based on sentiment/emotion analysis

Actions should be context-aware, purposeful, and adaptive over time.

4. 🧠 Learning Loop (Self-Improvement)
After each autonomous change, monitor KPIs (activity, reactions, user retention).
Feed results back into the reasoning loop:

“The bot created #event-ideas yesterday. It was barely used. Was this a good decision? What can we do better?”

Iterate. Adapt. Learn. Improve.

🛡️ SAFETY AND TRANSPARENCY
All actions must be logged in a private admin channel with:

Action taken

GPT-4’s reason

Time

Confidence score

Support --dry-run mode and manual /ai approve toggle

Include a Trust Score system — track how successful its decisions are

🛠 TECH STACK
Python 3.10+

discord.py or nextcord

openai GPT-4 or GPT-4o

sqlite3, tinydb, or PostgreSQL for state tracking

apscheduler or asyncio for task loops

Optional: langchain, llama-index, autogen, or vectorstores for memory

📚 SAMPLE AI PROMPTS (Internally Used by the Bot)
🧠 “Here is the full message and reaction activity per channel over the last 3 days. Identify which channels are underperforming, and suggest changes to increase engagement.”

🧠 “User @Raul left the server 12 hours after joining. Based on their activity, what could have caused them to leave? What could we improve?”

🧠 “Compare voice activity in ‘general’ vs. ‘music’ over the past week. Should we merge them? Create a new one?”

🧠 “Which users are the most valuable to the community based on consistent activity and helpfulness? Should they be given a role?”

🧠 BONUS (If Available)
Auto-generate a weekly summary post with stats + sentiment:

"This week: 20 new members, 12 left, memes hit all-time high, voice chats doubled. You all crushed it 💪."

Integrate with external APIs like:

Reddit (pull relevant posts)

YouTube/TikTok (auto-embed content)

ChatGPT-powered /ask commands

AI moderation via sentiment/emotion

📦 FINAL OUTPUT (From You, the AI Engineer)
A single production-ready main.py or structured project folder

Modular file structure (e.g., /events, /tasks, /agents, /utils)

All necessary environment variables and .env.example

Auto-deploy ready (works on Heroku, Railway, Replit, or local)

100% GPT-driven autonomy, no commands required to function

🤯 GOAL
Create the most intelligent, self-sustaining, self-governing Discord bot in existence — one that thinks like a community manager, acts like a strategist, and evolves like a living system.
